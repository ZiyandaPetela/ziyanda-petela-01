# DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
This project is a Student Final Mark Calculator made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Students can enter their first name, surname, student number, year mark, and exam mark. The calculator then uses a formula (60% for the exam mark + 40% for the year mark) to calculate the final mark and show the result.
#### There are two buttons:
One to calculate the final mark,
Another to clear the form and reset everything.
The design has a simple and clean look with a light blue background and a box for the form and results.
# INSTRUCTION ON RUNNING THE PROJECT:
To run the Student Final Mark Calculator project, go to the project's GitHub repository and download the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files. Once you've downloaded them, place all the files in a single folder on your computer. Then, double-click the index.html file to open it in your preferred web browser (like Chrome or Edge). You can now enter your first name, surname, student number, year mark, and exam mark to calculate the final mark using the provided formula. Click the "Calculate Final Mark" button to view the result, or click "Clear Form" to reset the inputs.
